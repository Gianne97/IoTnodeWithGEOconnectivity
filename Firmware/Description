STM32 MCU firmware processing flow:

1. The MCU initializes its core peripherals and the external sensor subsystem;
2. The Radio Modem Unit 'Join' procedure is recalled, the RMU joined status is periodically monitored by the MCU;
3. All the employed sensors in the subsystem are woken up and read sequentially;
4. The whole sensor data is encoded, and the TX message packet is assembled;
5. The Radio Modem Unit's 'Send' procedure is recalled, and the MCU checks for communication errors after this command is issued;
6. The MCU waits for the next transmission cycle, and the sensor subsystem is placed into 'Sleep' mode during this waiting period.
